# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of this software is taken seriously. Should a security vulnerability be discovered, it is requested to be reported responsibly as outlined below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please email [valid-chord.03@icloud.com](mailto:valid-chord.03@icloud.com). Your efforts in responsibly disclosing your findings are highly appreciated, and an acknowledgment of the emailed report will be sent within 48 hours.

### Security Vulnerability Response

Upon receiving a report, the following actions will be undertaken:

1. Confirmation of the report's receipt and initiation of an investigation.
2. Verification of the vulnerability and assessment of its impact.
3. If necessary, development and release of a patch to address the issue.
4. Public acknowledgment of the responsible disclosure, subject to the consent of the reporter.

### Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date will be agreed upon between the product security team and the bug submitter. The aim is to disclose the vulnerability fully as soon as a mitigation for users is available, as this is believed to be in the best interest of the users. A balance will be maintained to allow users adequate time to adapt while preventing active exploitation of the vulnerability.
